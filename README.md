# Pune-Air-Pollution-Analysis-Project
Analyzing Pune (Maharashtra, India) city's air pollution historical data. Visualizing various pollutants, calculating AQI and AQI bucket, predicting AQI and forecasting AQI.
This project is basic analysis of past 4 years of historical pollution data.
Pollution data is fetched from maps.openweather.org website using API.
Project is created as internship project at Edunet foundation's Ai & Cloud virtual intership.
Project is created in IBM Cloud's IBM Watson Studio, so importing csv data has some extra code with respect to IBM Watson Studio. Remove that unwanted code, if running on local machine.
Also forecasting AQI using limited data and computational resources was challenging, so forecasting accuracy is not that much good. But as this is learning project I ignored it.
